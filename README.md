QSS-M is a open source port of the original ID Software Quake. Over 25 years Quake 1.09 became Fitzquake to Quakespasm that lead to Quakespasm Spiked and now Quakespasm Spiked Multiplayer (QSS-M). NetQuake competitive multiplayer clients started with ProQuake, transitioned to Qrack or Mark V, and now QSS-M made possible by all those voluntary efforts.
